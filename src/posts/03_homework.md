### Challenge: Advanced if statements and logical operators

**Create program that shows messages if certain statements are true**
* Create variables isHuman and isHappy, both are booleans
* First condition: isHuman and isHappy are both true: "Happy Human"
* Second condition: isHuman is true and isHappy is false: "You are sad human, you should smile more. :)"
* Third condition: isHuman is false and isHappy is true: "You are happy but not human, what are you?"
* Fourth condition: Every other case: "Not human and not happy, there is something wrong!"

__Example output:__
```javascript
// If isHuman is true and isHappy is false output will be:
"You are sad human, you should smile more. :)"
```
