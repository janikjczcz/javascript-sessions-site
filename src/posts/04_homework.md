### Challenge: Function with multiple arguments

**Create program that outputs product information**
* Create function that accepts 3 arguments - 'Product Name', 'Price' and 'Tax'
* Create 3 different products that have different price (in usd) and are under different tax (you can make this up)
* Output will be: Product name, followed by price before tax, with tax and tax percent in % and tax amount in usd
* Set the default tax value to 21% if there is no argument for tax
* Run the function with all products

__Example output:__
```javascript
// If the function call is productInformation('OLED TV', 1600) output will be:
"Product name: OLED TV | Basic price: 1600 USD | Price after tax: 1936 USD | Tax percent: 21% | Tax amount: 336 USD."
