### Objects 101

* Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.
* In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Create object as variable "let myObject"
// After = put curly braces "{}"
// Assign object properties "size: 5"
// For multiple properties add "," at the end and add another on new line


let myBook = {
    title: '1984',
    author: 'George Orwell',
    pageCount: 326
}
```

* Access objects properties with . notation

```javascript
// I want to access title of myBook object

let myBook = {
    title: '1984',
    author: 'George Orwell',
    pageCount: 326
}

console.log(myBook.title)
// output: 1984
```

* We can access multiple properties
* Get book summary (title, author and page count) in following example using template string

```javascript
let myBook = {
    title: '1984',
    author: 'George Orwell',
    pageCount: 326
}

console.log(`Book ${myBook.title} by ${myBook.author} has ${myBook.pageCount} pages.`)

// output: "Book 1984 by George Orwell has 326 pages."
```

### Objects in functions

* Displaying properties of multiple objects can be repetitive using console log for each
* We can use function instead to speed up the process and make it lot cleaner

**Example:**
```javascript
// Create objects with properties

let bookOne = {
    title: '1984',
    author: 'George Orwell',
    pageCount: 326
}

let bookTwo = {
    title: 'A Peoples History',
    author: 'Howard Zinn',
    pageCount: 723
}

// Create function that accepts object

function getBookInfo(book) {
    return `Title: ${book.title}, Author: ${book.author}, Page count: ${book.pageCount}.`
}

// Log them in console

console.log(getBookInfo(bookOne))
console.log(getBookInfo(bookTwo))

// output:
// "Title: 1984, Author: George Orwell, Page count: 326."
// "Title: A Peoples History, Author: Howard Zinn, Page count: 723."
```

### Object references challenge
#### Account expense tracker

* Expense tracker with 4 functions
* addExpense, addIncome, resetAccount, getAccountSummary
* Example output: Account for Tony Stark has #900. $1000 in income. $100 in expenses.

**My solution:**
```javascript
// create account object
let myAccount = {
    name: 'Tony Stark',
    expenses: 0,
    income: 0
}


// addExpense
function addExpense(account, amount) {
    account.expenses = account.expenses + amount
}

// addIncome
function addIncome(account, amount) {
    account.income = account.income + amount
}

// resetAccount
function resetAccount(account) {
    account.expenses = 0
    account.income = 0
}

// getAccountSummary
function getAccountSummary(account) {
    let balance = account.income - account.expenses
    return `Account for ${account.name} has $${balance}. $${account.income} in income. $${account.expenses} in expenses.`
}

addIncome(myAccount, 1250)
addExpense(myAccount, 200)
addExpense(myAccount, 50)
console.log(getAccountSummary(myAccount))
resetAccount(myAccount)
console.log(getAccountSummary(myAccount))

// output:
// Account for Tony Stark has $1000. $1250 in income. $250 in expenses.
// Account for Tony Stark has $0. $0 in income. $0 in expenses. 
```
