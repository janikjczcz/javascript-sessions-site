### Challenge: Objects with functions and template strings

**Create program that outputs forecast for single day**
* Create 7 objects, each for day of the week
* Each day will have 3 properties: date, weather and temperature
* Date property: Monday, June 1st
* Weather property: sunny
* Temperature property: 25
* Return statement must be template string
* Create function that accepts day and returns following:
* Monday, June 1st will be sunny and 25°C.
* Log it to console

__Example output:__
```javascript
// If the function call is forecast(monday) output will be:
"Monday, June 1st will be sunny and 25°C."
```

**Bonus challenge**
* Output the whole week instead of single day with each date on new line :)

__Example output:__
```javascript
"Monday, June 1st will be sunny and 25°C. 
 Tuesday, June 2nd will be cloudy and 19°C. 
 Wednesday, June 3rd will be rainy and 18°C. 
 Thursday, June 4th will be sunny and 20°C. 
 Friday, June 5th will be cold and 12°C. 
 Saturday, June 6th will be sunny and 21°C.
