<h3>Challenge 01: Booleans and If Statements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create program that calculates size of clothing based on a child's age</li>
<li>Create variable age and give it number value</li>
<li>First condition: If age is 7 or lower the output would be: &quot;Age is {age as a number} and clothing size is 0 - 122cm&quot;</li>
<li>Second condition: If age is 8 the output would be: &quot;Age is {age as a number} and clothing size is 122cm - 134cm&quot;</li>
<li>Third condition: If age is 9 or higher the output would be: &quot;Age is {age as a number} and clothing size is 134cm+&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let age = 12

if (age &lt;= 7) {
    console.log('Age is ' + age + ' and clothing size is 0 - 122cm')
}

if (age === 8) {
    console.log('Age is ' + age + ' and clothing size is 122cm - 134cm')
}

if (age &gt;= 9) {
    console.log('Age is ' + age + ' and clothing size is 134cm+')
}

// Output will be: &quot;Age is 12 and correct size is 134cm+&quot;
